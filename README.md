# Fisher-Yates-Shuffle

This Fisher-Yates Shuffle program takes a list of integers ranging from 1-6 and shuffles them using the Fisher-Yates algorithm.
The Fisher Yates algorithm was created by Ronald Fisher and Frank Yates in 1938 in order to create a random permutation of a finite set of values.
This program states the list in numerical order pre-shuffle, shuffles the contents of the list using the Shuffle(), Swap(), and GetRandomNumber() methods, then 
prints the new order of contents post-shuffle.
